## Introduction

This page compiles frequently asked questions and answers about Claude Code Workflow Studio. If you can't find the information you're looking for, please contact us through GitHub Issues.

## General Questions

### Q1: What is Claude Code Workflow Studio?

**A:** Claude Code Workflow Studio is a VSCode extension that lets you visually design workflows for Claude Code. With no-code drag & drop operations, you can create complex workflows including Sub-Agent combinations and conditional branches.

Designed workflows can be exported as `.claude` files and run immediately in Claude Code.

### Q2: How is it different from Claude Code?

**A:** They have different roles:

- **Claude Code**: CLI tool to **execute** workflows
- **Claude Code Workflow Studio**: VSCode extension to **design** workflows

The relationship is that you design workflows in Workflow Studio and execute them in Claude Code.

### Q3: Is it free to use?

**A:** The extension itself is free. However, Claude API usage fees apply when running exported workflows in Claude Code (following Anthropic's pricing structure).

### Q4: Do I need programming experience?

**A:** No! You can create workflows with just drag & drop operations in the visual editor. No knowledge of markdown syntax or programming is required.

However, the ability to clearly explain tasks is helpful when writing prompts for Sub-Agents.

## Installation and Setup

### Q5: How do I install it?

**A:** Easy installation from VSCode Marketplace (Coming Soon):

1. Open VSCode
2. Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`)
3. Search for "Claude Code Workflow Studio"
4. Click **Install**

Currently preparing for Marketplace publication. We'll announce here when it's released.

### Q6: Is Claude Code required?

**A:** Yes, Claude Code is needed to run exported workflows. For Claude Code installation instructions, see the [official documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/claude-code).

However, you can design workflows without Claude Code (if you plan to use the exported files later).

### Q7: Can I use it offline?

**A:** Yes! Claude Code Workflow Studio operates completely offline. No network communication ensures privacy and security.

Workflow design, saving, and export all complete locally.

## Usage

### Q8: Where are workflows saved?

**A:** There are two save locations:

1. **Design Data**: `.vscode/workflows/*.json`
   - Format re-editable in the visual editor
   - Manageable with Git and shareable with team

2. **Export Files**: `.claude/agents/` and `.claude/commands/`
   - Format executable in Claude Code
   - Markdown frontmatter format

### Q9: Can I share workflows with others?

**A:** Yes, easily:

```bash
# Commit design data
git add .vscode/workflows/my-workflow.json
git commit -m "Add my workflow"
git push
```

Team members can pull and open the same workflow in the visual editor for editing.

### Q10: How many nodes can I add?

**A:** Maximum 50 nodes per workflow. Most workflows can be designed with 3-10 nodes.

For more complex processing, we recommend splitting workflows into multiples and running each as a SlashCommand.

### Q11: How is workflow execution order determined?

**A:** It's determined by **connection order** between nodes. Connecting from output port (right side) to input port (left side) defines execution order.

AskUserQuestion nodes branch based on the user's selected choice.

## Troubleshooting

### Q12: Editor won't open

**Solution**:

1. Restart VSCode
2. Verify extension is correctly installed
3. Update VSCode to latest version
4. Check error log in Developer Tools (`Ctrl+Shift+I` / `Cmd+Option+I`)

### Q13: Cannot save workflow

**Causes and Solutions**:

**Cause 1**: Workflow name contains invalid characters
- Use only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores
- Spaces and special characters are not allowed

**Cause 2**: Required fields are empty
- Set names for all nodes
- Prompt is required for Sub-Agent nodes

**Cause 3**: `.vscode/workflows/` directory doesn't exist
- Should be created automatically, but try creating it manually

### Q14: Exported file doesn't work

**Check**:

1. **Restart Claude Code**: To recognize new commands
2. **File location**: Correctly placed in `.claude/commands/`
3. **File format**: Markdown frontmatter is correct
4. **Agent files**: Required agents exist in `.claude/agents/`

### Q15: Workflow list not updating

**Solution**:

1. Click refresh button (↻) in Load dropdown
2. Close and reopen editor
3. Restart VSCode

### Q16: Can't connect nodes properly

**Tips**:

- Start from output port (right side of node)
- Drag to input port (left side of node)
- Ports highlight when hovering
- Hold Ctrl key for straight connections

## Advanced Usage

### Q17: Can I use variables or parameters?

**A:** Yes, use `{{variableName}}` syntax in Prompt nodes:

```
Analysis target: {{fileName}}
Output format: {{format}}
```

Claude Code substitutes values at runtime.

### Q18: How do I create conditional branches?

**A:** Two methods:

1. **AskUserQuestion Node**: User selects choice
2. **Branch Node**: Automatic judgment by conditional expression

Complex conditions can also be described in Sub-Agent prompts.

### Q19: Can I do error handling?

**A:** Yes, instruct in Sub-Agent prompts:

```
Read the data file.
If file not found, report to user and abort processing.
```

You can also set conditions like "file existence check" in Branch nodes.

### Q20: Is multi-language support available?

**A:** Yes! Automatically adapts to VSCode display language setting (`vscode.env.language`):

- **UI**: Toolbar, node palette, property panel
- **Export**: Documentation in generated `.claude` files

Supported languages: English, Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese
